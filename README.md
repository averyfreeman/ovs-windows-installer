# openvswitch windows installer
---
I saw someone asking about this recently in a blog I visited,
so I wanted to make it available to them, since I built it
inadvertently along with the rest of openvswitch

I don't have a Windows machine to build this on right now, and don't feel like spinning up a VM, so I created a workflows action runner for legacy .NET. Hopefully it will build the `.sln` file - 🤞🏼

the `.tar.xz` is the source code to be built on an MS machine
